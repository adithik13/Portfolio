Hi there! 

My name is Adithi Katikhaneni, and this is a working digital portfolio of some work that I've been doing that showcases my abilities in different programming languages and with different skills. 

Subdirectories marked as "Project" are larger assignments that accomplish more complex and multilayered tasks.

Subdirectories that are not marked with "Project" are smaller exercises that are much more straightforward and less involved, and serve as examples of understanding the logic and base level implementations of different programming concepts. 

- Project- Memory Manager Static Library: This project was completed in October 2024 for Operating Systems. It is a custom implementation of a Memory Manager Library that other processes can link to in order to complete tasks that require memory allocation. This was written in C++ for implementation in a Linux kernel.

- Project- Creating and Modifying System Calls: This was also completed for Operating Systems in September of 2024. This project was written in C and involved modifying and creating new system calls for a Linux OS. The code is most clearly seen in the patch file, marked p1.diff. The process_log subdirectory is a library that contains function implementatinos as well.
  
- Pipes: This project was a simple lab exercise that demonstrates how pipes work and can be utilized in C.

- EMG Signal Processing: This directory is a compilation of some work I have completed on a previous project for the research lab I am a part of.

- Server side networking: This simple exercise is a demonstration of writing server side conditions for accepting client messages. 

All subdirectories are currently located in the master branch.
